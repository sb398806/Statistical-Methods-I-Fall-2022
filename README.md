# Statistical-Methods-I-Fall-2022
Repository of code for labs assignments completed for PQHS 431.
These lab assignments required demonstrations of mastery for core principles and fundamental skills with a few requiring deeper dives into material that was more technically sophisticated. Using R and R Studio, I demonstrated my ability to clean, visualize, and analyze provided data sets. Some of the labs required short essays reacting to various topics presented in David Spiegelhalter's book, *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data*. 

Key topics included:
-  Exploratory data analysis
-  Placing research questions into statisical frameworks
-  Study development
-  Data handling
-  Statistical comparisons
-  Proper use of multi-predictor models for continuous and discrete data
